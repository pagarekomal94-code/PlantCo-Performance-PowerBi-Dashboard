# PlantCo-Performance-PowerBi-Dashboard 
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing the gross profit,quantity and sales performance of Plant Co. across multiple dimensions such as time (YTD vs PYTD), country, product category, and account profitability.

Using Power BI, the dashboard provides an interactive and consolidated view of business performance, enabling stakeholders to quickly identify profit trends, margin variations, and key growth or decline areas.

The solution helps management monitor current-year performance against previous-year benchmarks, evaluate country-wise contribution, and assess customer profitability to support data-driven strategic decisions.
